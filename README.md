## 👋 About Me
I design and automate secure, scalable cloud solutions using AWS, CI/CD, containers, and IaC. I enjoy building serverless systems, observable pipelines, and developer-friendly automation that reduces toil and improves reliability.

- 🎓 M.Tech (Software Engineering) — Vellore Institute of Technology Chennai (7.69 CGPA)
- 💼 Internship: TMIS IT Solutions — prompt engineering & AI tool design (Mar 2025)
- 🌱 Currently focused on advanced AWS services, Kubernetes, Terraform, and SRE practices

```text
Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, CloudFront, EKS, RDS, IAM, VPC)
DevOps: Jenkins, Git/GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, GitHub Actions
CI/CD: Jenkins Pipelines, AWS CodePipeline, Docker image pipelines, ECR
Monitoring: CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK
Other: Linux, Shell scripting, Postman, React (frontend basics)
```

Badges (swap values / theme as you prefer):

## 📊 Live GitHub Metrics (replace `username` if needed)
<!-- GitHub Readme Stats -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=judhayaprakash27052001-Git&show_icons=true&theme=dark&count_private=true" alt="github-stats" />
  <img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=judhayaprakash27052001-Git&layout=compact&theme=dark" alt="top-langs" />
</p>

Want a more "metric-driven" top banner? You can show:
- total commits (lifetime)
- repos contributed to / starred
- CI passing badge(s)
- uptime / reliability percentage for projects (manually maintained or via monitoring)

---

## 🚀 Selected Projects (highlights)
- **Secure Web Application for Financial Transactions** — React UI, responsive, validation (link: repo in profile)
- **CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins & Docker** — Jenkins pipelines for build/test/deploy, Dockerized apps, deployed on AWS EC2, images stored in ECR
- **AWS Contact Book (Serverless)** — S3 + CloudFront static UI, Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB backend, IAM-secured endpoints  
  GitHub (from resume): https://github.com/judhayaprakash27052001-Git/AWS-Contact-Book-Serverless-Project.git

(If you'd like, I can convert each project into a card with animated GIFs showing pipelines, architecture diagrams, and a short metrics line: tests passed | deploy time | avg latency.)

---

## 📈 Metrics & Achievements (example "neo" counters)
- Projects completed: 6+
- Serverless systems deployed: 2
- CI/CD pipelines built: 3
- Certifications: AZ-900 (Microsoft Azure Fundamentals), Google SRE course

You can make these counters animated by embedding animated SVG counters or GIFs (I can generate SVG code for animated counters that increment on page load).

---

## 🎨 Visual / Animated Enhancements (ideas I can implement)
- Neon / Neo header as an animated SVG (pure SVG animation — lightweight, retina-ready)
- Typing effect lines (already included via readme-typing-svg)
- Animated pipeline GIFs for each project (270×160 preview GIFs)
- Animated metric counters (SVG that counts up)
- Dark / Neon theme toggle (two sets of badges + images)
- An interactive architecture SVG (hoverable areas) — will require hosting or raw SVG embeds

If you want, I can generate:
- a neon animated SVG header with your name
- an animated SVG counter (e.g., "Projects: 06 → 10")
- small pipeline architecture SVG for a selected project

## 💡 How I built this README for you
I pulled key details from the resume you provided (name, education, skills, projects, links) and created a modern, metric-forward GitHub profile README structure with places for animated/neo visuals and dynamic GitHub metrics. The file above is ready to paste into your repository's README.md.

---

## Next — to personalize and finalize this README
Please provide the following so I can refine, personalize, and produce the animated SVGs/GIFs exactly how you want:

1. Confirm your preferred GitHub username to use for live stats (default I used: judhayaprakash27052001-Git).  
2. One-line tagline (eg: "DevOps & Cloud Engineer | AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform").  
3. Top 6 skills you want highlighted (order matters).  
4. Which projects (1–4) you want showcased on the README and each project's repo URL + 1–2 metric numbers for each (e.g., tests: 120, deploys: 24, uptime: 99.9%).  
5. Do you want an animated neon header SVG? If yes: preferred colors (e.g., neon-green/blue/pink), and whether you prefer dark or light theme.  
6. Provide a short bio (1–2 sentences) or confirm I should use the existing summary from your resume.  
7. Preferred contact methods to display (email / LinkedIn / portfolio / other).  
8. Any badges/stats you absolutely want (commits, followers, GitHub stars, top-langs, streaks).  
9. A profile GIF (neon or pipeline) URL if you have one; otherwise I will create SVG alternatives.  
10. Would you like SVG counter animations (yes/no)? If yes, which counters and their values.

Reply with these details and I will:
- generate a final README.md file with animated SVG headers and counters embedded inline,
- produce ready-to-paste SVG code for neon header and metric counters,
- create project cards with GIF placeholders and metric lines,
- and give instructions to deploy/remove any external services (like GitHub-readme-stats) if you want them enabled.

Would you like me to start by generating a neon animated SVG header and an animated project metric counter for the README?
